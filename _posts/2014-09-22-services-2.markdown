Glow works with datasets in common file formats like VCF or BGEN as well as common big data
standards. You can write queries using the native Spark SQL APIs in Python, SQL, R, Java, and Scala.
The same APIs allow you to bring your genomic data together with other datasets like electronic
health records, real world evidence, and medical images. Glow makes it easy to parallelize existing
tools and libraries implemented as command line tools or Pandas functions.
