If you've used Spark before, you don't need to learn any new APIs to get started with Glow. The
toolkit includes the building blocks that you need to perform the most common analyses right away:
- Datasources for loading VCF and BGEN files into Spark DataFrames
- Functions for performing quality control and data manipulation
- Variant normalization and lift over
- Regression functions
- Integration with Spark ML libraries for population stratification
- Utilities for piping DataFrames through command line tools
